## Mitwirken

First of all, _vielen Dank_ for considering participating to this joke, the
German government will thank you later! Feel free to throw in a few identifiers
here and there, and open a pull-request against the `hauptzweig` (German for
`main branch`). The initial translation was made by [Shemnei](https://github.com/Shemnei/) and [michidk](https://github.com/michidk/).
